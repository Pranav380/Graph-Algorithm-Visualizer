# Graph-Algorithm-Visualizer
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to visually explore and understand the working of common graph search algorithms: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and A (A-Star) Algorithm*.

🚀 Features

🎯 Visualize BFS, DFS and A* Search algorithm on a 20x20 grid.

🧱 Add/remove obstacles interactively to see algorithm behavior.

💾 Save and load grid configurations with backend integration.

🔄 Reset and rerun algorithms on any custom grid.

🌐 Fully responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

⚙️ Backend REST APIs built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB.

☁️ Hosted frontend (optional: Netlify) & backend (optional: Render/Railway).
